# Financial Risk-Sensitive Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Thesis Structure and Content Guide

This document provides a comprehensive outline and content guidance for your thesis on risk-sensitive reinforcement learning approaches to financial trading.

## Overarching "Rød Tråd" (Common Thread)

Throughout your thesis, maintain these consistent themes:

1. **The Risk-Sensitivity Journey**: Frame the thesis as an exploration of how to properly incorporate risk awareness into financial DRL, not just performance-chasing.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: Emphasize the careful design of your framework components, highlighting design choices and their rationale.

3. **Learning Through Failure**: Position negative results as valuable scientific findings that identify pitfalls for future researchers.

4. **Framework Contribution**: Continually remind readers that your primary contribution is a modular, extensible framework for exploring risk-sensitive approaches.

5. **Honesty in Evaluation**: Demonstrate scientific integrity through transparent reporting and analysis of limitations.
